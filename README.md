# P3Group-GUI-extension
### Repository for Graphical User Interface upgrade to P3-Group input system.
The original project used a pre-made image and relied on correct formatting of RGB colour values.
Now, users can design and process their inputs via a GUI built with python's `tkinter` module. This allows:
- More flexibility in creating input boundaries with a choice of shapes.
- Better accuracy with improved control over positioning, size, and rotation of canvas shapes.
- Accurate control of boundary conditions by direct setting of potential values, removing limitations of scaling based on RGB's 0-255 gradient.
- Potential to operate input, processing of e-field calculation, and display outputs within one user-friendly location.
